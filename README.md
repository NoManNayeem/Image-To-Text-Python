# Image to Text Python

## Project Description

**Image to Text Python** is a Python script designed to simplify the process of extracting text from images through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is a technology that allows you to convert scanned documents, images, or handwritten text into machine-readable text.

### Key Features

- **Image Text Extraction:** The script uses the Tesseract OCR engine and the Pillow (PIL) library to extract text from images.

- **Language Support:** It supports multiple languages for OCR, with the ability to specify the language for optimal results. The default language is Bengali ('ben').

- **User-Friendly:** The script provides an easy-to-use command-line interface, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users.

### How it Works

1. **Installation:** To use the script, you need to clone the GitHub repository and install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Usage:** After installation, you can run the `image_to_text.py` script and specify the image path as an argument. Optionally, you can specify the language for OCR. The script will process the image and display the extracted text in the terminal.

3. **Customization:** Users can customize the script according to their specific OCR needs, including choosing the language, modifying the Tesseract configuration, or integrating it into other projects.

### Use Cases

The project has several potential use cases, including but not limited to:

- **Data Entry Automation:** Automatically extract text from scanned documents or images to reduce manual data entry.

- **Translation Services:** Extract and translate text from images in different languages.

- **Text Analysis:** Analyze text extracted from images for data analysis or sentiment analysis.

- **Accessibility:** Convert text from images into accessible formats for visually impaired individuals.

### Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python packages:

- **Pillow (PIL):** Used for image opening and processing.
- **pytesseract:** Integrates with the Tesseract OCR engine for text extraction.

These dependencies can be easily installed using `pip`.

### License

The project is open-source and is licensed under the MIT License, allowing users to modify and distribute the code as needed. You can find the full license details in the `LICENSE` file in the project directory.

**Image to Text Python** simplifies the task of extracting text from images, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from data entry automation to language translation and accessibility enhancement. Whether you are a developer or a non-technical user, this project provides an efficient and accessible way to harness the power of OCR technology.
